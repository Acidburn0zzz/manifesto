manifesto
=========

A statement about ubiquitous encryption on the public, federated 
XMPP network. Developers of XMPP software, and operators of XMPP
services that are connected to the public, federated XMPP network, 
are both welcome to sign this statement. (Note that operators do not
need to offer open registration, only to run a service that connects
to the public, federated XMPP network.)

To sign, please add your name to the end of the file manifesto.txt 
and send a pull request at the github repository:

https://github.com/stpeter/manifesto

Alternatively, contact me via IM or email at <stpeter@stpeter.im>.

If you have questions, comments, or suggestions for improvement, 
please post to the operators@jabber.org discussion list:

Thanks!

Peter
